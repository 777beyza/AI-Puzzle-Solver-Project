# AI Puzzle Solver Project
 This project is a Python-based AI application that solves the 8-puzzle problem using BFS, DFS, IDS, and A* search algorithms (with Misplaced Tile and Manhattan Distance heuristics). It features a Tkinter-based GUI where users can generate random boards, manually input puzzles (with smart handling of the 0 tile), or load configurations from a file. The program checks if a state is solvable, supports step-by-step or full auto-solve animation, and works with 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 grids. It offers a clean and interactive way to visualize search algorithms in action.
